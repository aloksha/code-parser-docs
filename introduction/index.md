# Introduction of Dynamsoft Code Parser

When working with IDs, driver licenses, or sometimes even general barcodes, you may encounter results (usually as a plain string) that are "unreadable" but contain all the useful information you need. With our new SDK, Dynamsoft Code Parser (DCP), making sense of these types of results is easier than ever.

Based on JavaScript and WebAssembly, DCP can run in all major modern browsers on all major platforms.
